# orographic_precip

This repo represents my work on a 3 month project at the German Geoscience Institute. The goal was to investigate parameterizing spatially variable precipitation in mountainous terrain in a landscape evolution model. In particular, I evaluated precipitation from the Linear Theory of Orographic Precipitation (Smith and Barstad, 2004) and compared it to observed precipitation from TRMM (Bookhagen and Burbank, 2010).

*report.html* is probably most interesting to someone else since this represents my "lab notebook" from my analyses. Hopefully the information in my report will enable someone else to continue this project and come up with a solution for parameterizing spatially variable precipitation in a landscape evolution model.
